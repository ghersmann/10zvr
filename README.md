# Ladies and Gentlemen,

2023 was the 10 year anniversary of the snowboard competition series Zillertal Välley Rälley. I've been a photographer there for those 10 years. Now it's time to build a celebratory gallery with the best photos from those 10 years.

This is so far a testing platform for me to test things that I learn during my education in web development with Coding Bootcamps Europe.

To seasoned developers this will most of the time really look like beginner stuff, but, you gotta start somewhere.
